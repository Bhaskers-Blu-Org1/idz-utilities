I.    Introduction

	This tutorial will guide the user through the various steps for
building and debugging the Global Auto Mart (GAM) sample.  If there is a
system administrator that administrates the CICS and DB2 resources they will
need to set up the GAM databases and define the CICS resources in order to
complete this tutorial.

II.   Defining the Database tables
        A.  There is a COBOL file GAM0VDB that is provided for inserting
            data into the GAM Sample Database Tables.
        B.  It should be compiled with the following provided copybooks:
            GAM0BCD, GAM0BDD, GAM0BED, GAM0BMD, GAM0BPD, GAM0BUD.
        C.  Once compiled GAM0VDB can be run with the sample JCL GAM0VCDB
        D.  This JCL drops the required tables if they already exist,
            creates the tables, and then runs GAM0VDB to populate the
            tables.
        E.  In the JCL provide the database schema name by changing all
            instances of &SCHEMA to match the desired schema name.

III.  Initial Setup

	A.  First Create a z/OS connection to the host system.
	B.  Copy all of the COBOL, BMS, and Copybook files from the GAM COBOL
            Sample into a corresponding PDS.
	C.  Create three z/OS Projects, one for assembling the BMS Maps
            (Project A), one for assembling and linking the BMS Maps
            (Project B), and one for compiling the cobol source files (Project
            C), by going to the File Menu Bar and selecting
            File->New->Project.  When the wizard comes up type the filter
            text z/OS and select the z/OS project option or scroll through
            the list to the z/OS folder expanding it and selecting the z/OS
            project, and fill in the required information for the wizard.
	D.  Under the z/OS project for assembling the BMS Maps (Project A)
            create three subprojects GAM0MC1, GAM0MC2, and GAM0MC3.  To create
            a subproject right click on the z/OS project and select
            New -> MVS Subproject.  Then fill in the required information that
            is asked for by the wizard. **
	E.  Under the z/OS project for assembling and linking the BMS Maps
            (Project B) create three subprojects GAM0MC1, GAM0MC2, and
            GAM0MC3. **
	F.  Under the z/OS project for compiling the COBOL file (Project C)
            create four subprojects one for each of the following COBOL files:
            GAM0VMI, GAM0VMM, GAM0VII, & GAM0VSI. **
	G.  If not already done, copy the BMS maps to an assembler PDS.
	H.  From the assembler PDS add GAM0MC1.asm, GAM0MC2.asm, and
            GAM0MC3.asm to the Assemble subproject.  To add a file to the
            subproject right click on the file select Add to Subproject.  In
            the dialog that pops up select the project and subproject the file
            is being added to.
	I.  Add GAM0MC1.asm to the GAM0MC1 subproject for assembling and
            linking, GAM0MC2.asm to the GAM0MC2 subproject for assembling and
            linking, and GAM0MC3.asm to the GAM0MC3 subproject for assembling
            and linking.
        J.  Add GAM0VMI.cbl to the GAM0VMI subproject, GAM0VMM.cbl to the
            GAM0VMM subproject, GAM0VII.cbl to the GAM0VII subproject and
            GAM0VSI.cbl to the GAM0VSI subproject.

** When naming the subprojects, this tutorial named each subproject after the
   name of the file that it will contain.  Therefore this tutorial will
   refer to the subproject by the name of the file that it contains.
   (i.e. the GAM0VMI subproject contains the GAM0VMI.cbl file)

IV.   Assembling the BMS Maps
	
	A.  Defining the Assemble Properties
                On Each Assemble Subproject: ***
		1.  Right click on the Assemble Subproject and select
                    Properties
		2.  In the Properties Dialog click on the Assembler Settings
		3.  Expand the ELAXFASM (or equivalent) Procedure
		4.  Double click on the ASM Step or highlight the ASM Step and
                    click Edit Step...
		5.  Set the Assembler options to:  SYSPARM(DSECT),NOOBJECT,DECK
		6.  Set the Listing Output Data Set to: the corresponding
                    listing data set
                7.  Set the Object Deck Data Set to: the corresponding object
                    data set
		8.  If different from the default Macro Libraries location
                    provide the correct location of your system's macro
                    libraries PDSs.
		9.  Also include in the macro libraries the PDS with the CICS
                    Macros needed for BMS Maps.
		10. Set the Additional JCL to:
                    //SYSPUNCH DD DISP=SHR,DSN="COPY LIBRARY PDS"("COPYBOOK
                    THAT NEEDS TO BE GENERATED")  i.e.
                    //SYSPUNCH DD DISP=SHR,DSN=TEST.COPYLIB(GAM0MC1)

                    For each subproject the copybook name that is generated
                    needs to match the name of the map file.

                11. Click OK, then Click Apply, then Click OK
                12. Once the properties have been set right click on the

                    Submit
                14. Once the job has been submitted expand the JES Job Monitor
                    in the Remote Systems View, expand My Jobs and find the JOB
                    output or right click on My Jobs and select show in table
                    and find the JOB output, to see if the job completed
                    successfully.

        *** To Expediate Setup if the subproject is going to contain properties
            identical to other subprojects, the properties can be exported to
            an xml file and can be imported into other subprojects.

            To Export subproject properties:
                1.  Right click on the subproject from which the properties are
                    to be exported.
                2.  Select Export Properties...
                3.  Choose a destination and a name for the .xml file in the
                    Save As Dialogue and click ok

            To Import subproject properties:
                1.  Right click on the subproject that the properties are to
                    be imported into.
                2.  Browse for and select the .xml file to use and click ok

                6.  Set the Listing Output Data Set, Debug Data Set, & Object
                    Deck Data Set to a corresponding PDS where the different
                    artifacts, that are created from the compiler, should be
                    written
                7.  Set the Copy Libraries to: the PDS that the supplied
                    COPYBOOKS were copied to and to the CICS Copy Library where
                    the COBOL DFHAID can be found.  Also if the SQLCA copylib
                    is not a file that the procedures point to ensure that
                    this PDS is provided here as well.
                8.  If XML Feedback is desired ensure that the Support Error

                    the XML file should be generated
                9.  Set the Database Request Module Location to: a desired DBRM
                    PDS
                10. Work with the Database Administrator to determine which is
                    the best method for binding the module to a database
                    package and access plan, either by in-line JCL or through a
                    bind file.

                    If using the in-line JCL method, the SYSTSIN should look
                    similar to:
                    ***Note if the Bind Procedure needs a Steplib data set it
                       can be added to the top of the SYSTSIN instructions as
                       demonstrated in the sample JCL

                13. Double click on the LINK step or highlight the LINK step
                    and click Edit Step...
                14. Set the Load Module Location to: the Load Library that CICS
                    uses.
                15. Add any link libraries that are needed for the project to
                    the Link Libraries field.  (i.e. any link libraries needed
                    for debugging)
                16. Click OK, then click on the JCL Job Card and Data Set
                    Option
                17. Ensure that the JCL Job Card is correctly configured for
                    compiling on the host system and that the JCL Data Set is
                    set to the PDS where the JCL should be created
                18. Click OK, then click Apply, then click OK

        C.  COMPILING THE PROJECT
                1.  Right click on the z/OS Project and select Rebuild
                2.  Either from the Remote Systems View or the Remote System
                    Details make sure that the jobs submitted from the
                    rebuilding of the project were completed successfully

VII.  Defining the CICS Resource Definitions

        A.  The CICS Resource Definitions should map to the following Program
            Definitions (PD), Transaction Definitions (TD), DB2Entry
            Definitions (DB2ED), and DB2Trans Definitions (DB2TD).
            There is a sample JCL GAMCSDUP that will define
            these resources automatically.
                1.  GAM0VMM maps to GAM0VMM PD
                2.  GAM0VMI maps to GAM0VMI PD
                3.  GAM0VII maps to GAM0VII PD
                4.  GAM0VSI maps to GAM0VSI PD
                5.  GAM0VMM PD maps to GBMM TD
                6.  GAM0VMI PD maps to GBMI TD
                7.  GAM0VII PD maps to GBII TD
                8.  GAM0VSI PD maps to GBSI TD
                9.  GBSI TD maps to GBSI DB2TD
                10. GBII TD maps to GBII DB2TD
                11. GBMI TD maps to GBMI DB2TD
                12. GBMM TD maps to GBMM DB2TD
                13. GBSI DB2TD maps to GBMI DB2ED
                14. GBII DB2TD maps to GBMI DB2ED
                15. GBMI DB2TD maps to GBMI DB2ED
                16. GBMM DB2TD maps to GBMI DB2ED

VIII. Running and Debugging the GAM Application using DTCN

        A.  To run the application type the transaction GBMI within
            CICS and the GAM Sample should launch.

        B.  To debug the application using DTCN:
            1.  In the workbench go to the Debug Perspective by going
                to Window in the File Menu bar and selecting
                Open Perspective -> Debug
            2.  In the Debug View ensure that the Debug UI Daemon is
                listening on port: 8001 by clicking the listening icon
                (The listening icon is next to the menu button which
                 is next to the minimize and maximize buttons on the
                 right side of the Debug View)
            3.  In CICS type the transaction id DTCN
            4.  In the Program Id(s) fields type in GAM0VMI, GAM0VMM,
                GAM0VII, and GAM0VSI
            5.  Change Session Type to TCP
            6.  Set Port Number to 8001
            7.  Set Display ID to the ip address of the workstation that
                the WD/z workbench is running on.  The ip address can be
                obtained from the menu pop up on the listening icon.
            8.  Press PF4 to save the configurations and PF3 to exit.
            9.  Run the GBMI transaction and the program should be
                loaded into the WD/z debugger.
